Supervised Learning 

Unsupervised Learning 

Regression - Simple(linear, non-linear) and Multiple (linear and non linear)

Regression Algorithms 
Oridinal Regression, Poisson Regression, Fast forest quantile Regression, 
Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Stepwise, Ridge regression,
Bayesian linear regression, 
Nueral network regression, 
Decision forest regression,
Boosted decision tree regression, 
KNN (K-nearest neighbours)

Linear regression  y = theta0 + theta1.x1
theta1 - slope or gradient, theta0 - intercept/bias coefficient 
No parameter tuning required

Mean Squared err 

xbar, ybar 

Model evaluation approaches 
1. Train and test same dataset. 
Err - E(1/n(a-p))

Training accuracy 
- over fitting, 

Out of Sample accuracy 
- should have high out of sample accuracy
- use Train test split 

K fold cross validation 
dataset divide into folds avg of all folds accuracy
